## Introduction

Automatic cover detection presents a significant theoretical and practical challenge in Music
Information Retrieval (MIR). It plays a crucial role in maintaining comprehensive music
databases due to the frequent reinterpretation of songs by different artists and the release
of alternate versions by original artists. Besides aiding content organization for improved
music discovery, cover song identification (CSI) also facilitates copyright enforcement and
ensures proper attribution, addressing legal and ethical concerns in digital music distribution.
Despite successful implementations on small datasets, scalability remains an issue,
while scalable solutions often lack the required accuracy

## Requirements

In order to run the code in this repository it is necessary to have the following packages installed:

numpy==1.26.3
librosa==0.10.1
matplotlib==3.8.2
pydub==0.25.1
pytube==15.0.0
essentia==2.1b6.dev1110
ipython==7.34.0

Additionally, pydub and pytube might ask the user to install FFmpeg codecs. In order to install them on Linux just run:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```


## Contents

The repository contains: one folder called preamble, containing all the code necessary to run the repo; 
two ready to run scripts, that use the code inside the folder preamble; and a jupyter notebook that run the scripts and also display the results.
